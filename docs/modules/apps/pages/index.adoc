= Apps

== Overview

Wolf will start different Docker containers that are preconfigured for different apps such as Steam, Pegasus or Firefox.
Once the container is launched, Wolf streams the output to the connected Moonlight client.

Currently, when opening and closing the app through Moonlight, the app container will be deleted. Therefore, all data except for the mounted paths will be deleted, which ensures application consistency to some extent. However, if modifications to the container are needed, such as installing additional software, the best approach is to create a custom app image. Wolf uses the same app image as in the GoW project. Therefore, you can refer to this https://games-on-whales.github.io/gow/adding-an-app.html[link] for customizing app content.

See each subpage for further details and additional configuration steps.
